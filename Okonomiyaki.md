Okonomiyaki
-----------

A Japanese savory cabbage pancake dish. Due to my lack of authentic ingredients,
this recipe is a work in progress.

Ingredients
-----------

-   3 large eggs

-   1/2 cup water

-   2 Tbsp soy sauce

-   1 Tbsp sesame oil

-   3/4 - 1 cup all-purpose flour

-   a quarter cabbage, diced

-   ~1 shredded carrots

-   3 diced green onions

-   teaspoon diced Ginger

-   Bacon strips

-   Ketchup, Mayo, sriracha, etc

Method
------

Â 

1.  Whisk the eggs, soy sauce, water, sesame oil in a bowl. Whisk the flour into
    the mixture in parts until thick like a pancake (?) batter.

2.  Add the diced cabbage, carrots and green onions to the batter. Stir until
    well coated. Aim for the consistency of coleslaw (?).

3.  Over medium heat and an oiled pan, add enough cabbage batter to make a disk
    6 inches in diameter and half an inch in thickness. Form the shape with a
    spatula.

4.  Place bacon strips on the top side. After 3-5 minutes, flip the pancake
    bacon-side-down.

5.  Serve with long lines of ketchup and mayo, garnish with green onions and
    fried onions.
